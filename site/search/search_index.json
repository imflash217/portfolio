In a hash table, the data is stored in an array format where each data-value has its own unique index-value. Due to this feature, the access to data becomes very fast if we know the desired index-value; irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hashing to generate the index where an element is to be inserted or to be located from. Hashing Hashing Hashing is a technique to map a range of keys into a range of indexes (usually of an array). A very generic hashing function is modulo operator ( x % y ). Example Example of Hashing Consider a hash-table of size=20 Following ( key , value ) pairs to be stored using the hash-table 1 2 3 4 5 dict = { 9 : 20 , 12 : 70 , 42 : 80 , 7 : 25 , 2 : 21 } Key Hash Array index 9 9 % 20 = 9 9 12 12 % 20 = 12 12 42 42 % 20 = 2 2 7 7 % 20 = 7 7 2 2 % 20 = 2 2 As we can see that a given hashing function can create the same hash-value from two different keys. (in above table keys 42 and 2 ). So we use Linear Probing to resolve conflicts. Linear Probing Linear Probing Linear Probing is a method used to resolve conflicts in the hash-value. It may happen that the hash-function creates an already used index of the array. In such case we search the next empty location of the array by looking into the next cell until we find an empty cell So in our above example, the updated hash-table would map key = 2 to index = 3 : Key Hash Array index 9 9 % 20 = 9 9 12 12 % 20 = 12 12 42 42 % 20 = 2 2 7 7 % 20 = 7 7 2 2 % 20 = 2 3 Search search() method for hash-table Search Delete delete() method for hash-table Delete Python Implementation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 class HashTable : def __init__ ( self , table_size ): \"\"\" Args: table_size (int): the size of the hash table. \"\"\" super () . __init__ () self . table_size = table_size self . hash_table = [[] for _ in range ( self . table_size )] ## ! this kind of nested lists DS is useful for CHAINING def hashing_func ( self , key ): \"\"\"Hashing Function Args: key (int): the key Returns: [int]: index of the hash-table \"\"\" hash = key % self . table_size return hash def insert_linear_probing ( self , key , value ): \"\"\" Insert a (key, value) pair in the hash table.

Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hashing to generate the index where an element is to be inserted or to be located from.","title":"Definition"},{"location":"blogs/algorithms/blog_01292021_hashtables/#hashing","text":"Hashing Hashing is a technique to map a range of keys into a range of indexes (usually of an array).

What's in this tutorial? Fundamentals : reordering, composition, and decomposition of tensors. Operations : rearrange , reduce , repeat How much can you do with a single operation? Preparations 1 2 3 import numpy from utils import display_np_arrays_as_images display_np_arrays_as_images () Load a batch of images 1 2 3 4 5 ## there are 6 images of shape 96x96 ## with 3 color channels packed as tensors images = np . load ( \"./resources/tes_images.npy\" , allow_pickle = False ) print ( images . shape , images . dtype ) ## (6, 96, 96, 3), float64 1 2 ## display the 1st image (whole 4d tensor can't be rendered) images [ 0 ] 1 images [ 1 ] We will use three opeartions: rearrange , reduce , repeat 1 from einops import rearrange , reduce , repeat Meet \"rearrange\" rearrange As its name suggests; it rearranges elements. Below, we swap height and width . In other words, below we transpose first two axes/dimensions. 1 rearrange ( images [ 0 ], \"h w c -> w h c\" ) Composition of axes Transposition is very common and useful; but let's move to other operations provided by einops composition using rearrange() : height einops allows seamlessly composing batch and height to a new height dimension. Below we just rendered all images in the 4D tensor by collapsing it to a 3D tensor. 1 rearrange ( images , \"b h w c -> (b h) w c\" ) composition using rearrange() : width einops allows seamlessly composing batch and width to a new width dimension. Below we just rendered all images in the 4D tensor by collapsing it to a 3D tensor. 1 rearrange ( images , \"b h w c -> h (b w) c\" ) Resulting dimensions are computed very simply. Length of any newly computed axes/dimension is a product of its components 1 2 3 ## [6, 96, 96, 3] -> [96, (6*96), 3] a = rearrange ( images , \"b h w c -> h (b w) c\" ) a . shape 1 (96, 576, 3) We can compose more than 2 axes/dimensions. Let's flatten the whole 4D array into a 1D array. The resulting 1D array contains as many elements as the original 4D array. 1 2 3 ## [6, 96, 96, 3] -> [(6*96*96*3)] a = rearrange ( images , \"b h w c -> (b h w c)\" ) a . shape 1 (165888, ) Decomposition of axes Decomposition is the inverse process of composition. It represents an existing axis as a combination of new axes . Several decompositions are possible. Some examples are shown below: Combining composition and decomposition Combining composition & decomposition 1 2 3 4 ## here b1=2, decomposes b=6 into \"b1=2\" and \"b2=3\" ## keeping b = b1*b2 a = rearrange ( images , \"(b1 b2) w h c -> b1 b2 w h c\" , b1 = 2 ) a . shape ## (2, 3, 96, 96, 3) 1 (2, 3, 96, 96, 3) An example Combining composition & decomposition 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## here b1=2, decomposes b=6 into \"b1=2\" and \"b2=3\" ## keeping b = b1*b2 a = rearrange ( images , \"(b1 b2) w h c -> (b1 h) (b2 w) c\" , b1 = 2 ) a . shape ## (2*96, 3*96, 3) a Another combination Combining composition & decomposition 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## here b1=2, decomposes b=6 into \"b1=2\" and \"b2=3\" ## keeping b = b1*b2 a = rearrange ( images , \"(b1 b2) w h c -> (b2 h) (b1 w) c\" , b1 = 2 ) a . shape ## (3*96, 2*96, 3) a Another example: width_to_height Move part of the width dimension to height We should call this width_to_height as the image width shrunk by 2 and height incresed by 2. But all pixels are same!!! 1 2 3 4 a = rearrange ( images , \"b h (w w2) c -> (h w2) (b w) c\" , w2 = 2 ) a . shape ## (96*2, 6*48, 3) a Another example: heigh_to_width Move part of the height dimension to width We should call this height_to_width as the image height shrunk by 2 and width incresed by 2. But all pixels are same!!! 1 2 3 a = rearrange ( images , \"b (h h2) w c -> (b h) (w h2) c\" , h2 = 2 ) a . shape ## (6*48, 96*2, 3) Order of axes matter The order of axes in composition and decomposition is of prime importance. It affects the way data is being transposed. Below examples show the impacts. An example 1 2 3 a = rearrange ( images , \"b h w c -> h (b w) c\" ) ## notice the ordering of (b w) a . shape ## (96, 6*96, 3) a v/s 1 2 3 b = rearrange ( images , \"b h w c -> h (w b) c\" ) ## notice the ordeing of (w b) b . shape ## (96, 96*6, 3) b Though the shapes of both a and b are same but the ordering of pixels are different. RULE : The rule of importance is just as for digits. The leftmost digit is most significant . Neighboring number differ in rightmost axis. What will happen if b1 and b2 are reordered before composing to width (as shown in examples below): 1 2 rearrange ( images , \"(b1 b2) h w c -> h (b1 b2 w) c\" , b1 = 2 ) ## produces \"einops\" rearrange ( images , \"(b1 b2) h w c -> h (b2 b1 w) c\" , b1 = 2 ) ## prodices \"eoipns\" Meet \"reduce\" In einops we don't need to guess what happened (like below) 1 x . mean ( - 1 ) Because we write clearly what happened (as shown below) 1 2 3 import einops.reduce reduce ( x , \"b h w c -> b h w\" , \"mean\" ) If an axis was not present in the output definition --you guessed it -- it was reduced Average over batch Average over batch 1 2 3 u = reduce ( images , \"b h w c -> h w c\" , \"mean\" ) ## reduce using \"mean\" across the \"batch\" axis u . shape ## (96, 96, 3) u The above code is similar to the standard code (without einops ) as shown below 1 2 3 u = images . mean ( axis = 0 ) ## find mean across the \"batch\" dimension u . shape ## (96, 96, 3) u But, the code with einops is much more readable and states the operations clearly. Reducing over multiple axes Example of reducing over several dimensions.

Electromagnetic Spectrum Electromagnetic Spectrum The different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have very different effects upon interaction with matter. Starting with low frequency radio waves , the human body is quite transparent ( you can listen to your portable radio inside your home since the waves pass freely through the walls of your house and even through the person beside you! ) As you move upward through microwaves and infrared to visible light , you absorb more and more strongly. In the lower ultraviolet range, all the UV from the sun is absorbed in a thin outer layer of your skin. As you move further up into the x-ray region of the spectrum, you become transparent again, because most of the mechanisms for absorption are gone. You then absorb only a small fraction of the radiation, but that absorption involves the more violent ionization events . Each portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has quantum energies appropriate for the excitation of certain types of physical processes. The energy levels for all physical processes at the atomic and molecular levels are quantized, and if there are no available quantized energy levels with spacings which match the quantum energy of the incident radiation, then the material will be transparent to that radiation , and it will pass through. If electromagnetic energy is absorbed, but cannot eject electrons from the atoms of the material, then it is classified as non-ionizing radiation, and will typically just heat the material. Microwaves Microwaves The quantum energy of microwave photons is in the range 0.00001 to 0.001 eV which is in the range of energies separating the quantum states of molecular rotation and torsion . The interaction of microwaves with matter other than metallic conductors ** will be to rotate molecules and produce heat as result of that molecular motion. Conductors will strongly absorb microwaves and any lower frequencies because they will cause electric currents which will heat the material. Most matter, including the human body, is largely transparent to microwaves. High intensity microwaves, as in a microwave oven where they pass back and forth through the food millions of times, will heat the material by producing molecular rotations and torsions. Since the quantum energies are a million times lower than those of x-rays, they cannot produce ionization and the characteristic types of radiation damage associated with ionizing radiation. Infrared Infrared The quantum energy of infrared photons is in the range 0.001 to 1.7 eV which is in the range of energies separating the quantum states of molecular vibrations. Infrared is absorbed more strongly than microwaves, but less strongly than visible light. The result of infrared absorption is heating of the tissue since it increases molecular vibrational activity. Infrared radiation does penetrate the skin further than visible light and can thus be used for photographic imaging of subcutaneous blood vessels. Visible Light Visible Light The primary mechanism for the absorption of visible light photons is the elevation of electrons to higher energy levels. There are many available states, so visible light is absorbed strongly. With a strong light source, red light can be transmitted through the hand or a fold of skin, showing that the red end of the spectrum is not absorbed as strongly as the violet end. While exposure to visible light causes heating, it does not cause ionization with its risks. You may be heated by the sun through a car windshield, but you will not be sunburned - that is an effect of the higher frequency uv part of sunlight which is blocked by the glass of the windshield. Ultraviolet Ultraviolet The near ultraviolet is absorbed very strongly in the surface layer of the skin by electron transitions . As you go to higher energies, the ionization energies for many molecules are reached and the more dangerous photoionization processes take place. Sunburn is primarily an effect of uv, and ionization produces the risk of skin cancer . The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is important for human health because it absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun before it reaches the surface. The higher frequencies in the ultraviolet are ionizing radiation and can produce harmful physiological effects ranging from sunburn to skin cancer . Health concerns for UV exposure are mostly for the range 290-330 nm in wavelength, the range called UVB . According to Scotto, et al , the most effective biological wavelength for producing skin burns is 297 nm . Their research indicates that the biological effects increase logarithmically within the UVB range, with 330 nm being only 0.1% as effective as 297 nm for biological effects. So it is clearly important to control exposure to UVB. X-ray X-men First Header Second Header Since the quantum energies of x-ray photons are much too high to be absorbed in electron transitions between states for most atoms, they can interact with an electron only by knocking it completely out of the atom. That is, all x-rays are classified as ionizing radiation . This can occur by giving all of the energy to an electron ( photoionization ) or by giving part of the energy to the electron and the remainder to a lower energy photon ( Compton Scattering ). At sufficiently high energies, the x-ray photon can create an electron positron pair.

Starting with low frequency radio waves , the human body is quite transparent ( you can listen to your portable radio inside your home since the waves pass freely through the walls of your house and even through the person beside you! ) As you move upward through microwaves and infrared to visible light , you absorb more and more strongly. In the lower ultraviolet range, all the UV from the sun is absorbed in a thin outer layer of your skin. As you move further up into the x-ray region of the spectrum, you become transparent again, because most of the mechanisms for absorption are gone. You then absorb only a small fraction of the radiation, but that absorption involves the more violent ionization events . Each portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has quantum energies appropriate for the excitation of certain types of physical processes. The energy levels for all physical processes at the atomic and molecular levels are quantized, and if there are no available quantized energy levels with spacings which match the quantum energy of the incident radiation, then the material will be transparent to that radiation , and it will pass through. If electromagnetic energy is absorbed, but cannot eject electrons from the atoms of the material, then it is classified as non-ionizing radiation, and will typically just heat the material.","title":"Electromagnetic Spectrum"},{"location":"blogs/physics/blog_01282021/#microwaves","text":"Microwaves The quantum energy of microwave photons is in the range 0.00001 to 0.001 eV which is in the range of energies separating the quantum states of molecular rotation and torsion . The interaction of microwaves with matter other than metallic conductors ** will be to rotate molecules and produce heat as result of that molecular motion. Conductors will strongly absorb microwaves and any lower frequencies because they will cause electric currents which will heat the material. Most matter, including the human body, is largely transparent to microwaves. High intensity microwaves, as in a microwave oven where they pass back and forth through the food millions of times, will heat the material by producing molecular rotations and torsions. Since the quantum energies are a million times lower than those of x-rays, they cannot produce ionization and the characteristic types of radiation damage associated with ionizing radiation.","title":"Microwaves"},{"location":"blogs/physics/blog_01282021/#infrared","text":"Infrared The quantum energy of infrared photons is in the range 0.001 to 1.7 eV which is in the range of energies separating the quantum states of molecular vibrations. Infrared is absorbed more strongly than microwaves, but less strongly than visible light. The result of infrared absorption is heating of the tissue since it increases molecular vibrational activity. Infrared radiation does penetrate the skin further than visible light and can thus be used for photographic imaging of subcutaneous blood vessels.","title":"Infrared"},{"location":"blogs/physics/blog_01282021/#visible-light","text":"Visible Light The primary mechanism for the absorption of visible light photons is the elevation of electrons to higher energy levels. There are many available states, so visible light is absorbed strongly. With a strong light source, red light can be transmitted through the hand or a fold of skin, showing that the red end of the spectrum is not absorbed as strongly as the violet end. While exposure to visible light causes heating, it does not cause ionization with its risks. You may be heated by the sun through a car windshield, but you will not be sunburned - that is an effect of the higher frequency uv part of sunlight which is blocked by the glass of the windshield.","title":"Visible Light"},{"location":"blogs/physics/blog_01282021/#ultraviolet","text":"Ultraviolet The near ultraviolet is absorbed very strongly in the surface layer of the skin by electron transitions . As you go to higher energies, the ionization energies for many molecules are reached and the more dangerous photoionization processes take place. Sunburn is primarily an effect of uv, and ionization produces the risk of skin cancer . The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is important for human health because it absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun before it reaches the surface. The higher frequencies in the ultraviolet are ionizing radiation and can produce harmful physiological effects ranging from sunburn to skin cancer . Health concerns for UV exposure are mostly for the range 290-330 nm in wavelength, the range called UVB . According to Scotto, et al , the most effective biological wavelength for producing skin burns is 297 nm . Their research indicates that the biological effects increase logarithmically within the UVB range, with 330 nm being only 0.1% as effective as 297 nm for biological effects. So it is clearly important to control exposure to UVB.","title":"Ultraviolet"},{"location":"blogs/physics/blog_01282021/#x-ray","text":"X-men First Header Second Header Since the quantum energies of x-ray photons are much too high to be absorbed in electron transitions between states for most atoms, they can interact with an electron only by knocking it completely out of the atom. That is, all x-rays are classified as ionizing radiation . This can occur by giving all of the energy to an electron ( photoionization ) or by giving part of the energy to the electron and the remainder to a lower energy photon ( Compton Scattering ). At sufficiently high energies, the x-ray photon can create an electron positron pair.

Discussion The core of this recipe concerns with the use of heapq module. The methods heapq.heappush() and heapq.heappop() insert and remove items from self._queue in such a way that the first tem in the list has the smallest priority . The heappop() method always returns the smallest item; so that is the key idea to make our PriorityQueue pop correct items. In this recipe the queue consists of tuple (-priority, idx, item) . The priority value is negated to get the queue to sort items from highest priority to lowest priority . This is opposite from normal heap ordering; which sorts items from smallest to highest value. The role of the idx value is to properly order items with the same priority level. By keeping a constantly increasing index, the items will be sorted according to the order in which they were inserted.

For example: 1 2 ## finding keys in common a . keys () & b . keys () ##{\"x\", \"y\"} 1 2 ## finding keys in a, that are not in b a . keys () - b . keys () ## {\"z\"} 1 2 ## finding (key, value) pair in common a . items () & b . items () ## {(\"y\", 2)} These kinds of operations can also be used to alter or filter dictionary contents. For, example, suppose you want to make a new dictionary with selected keys removed. Below is a sample code using a dictionary comprehension 1 2 ## make a new dictionary with certain keys removed c = { key : a [ key ] for key in a . keys () - { \"z\" , \"w\" }} ## {\"x\":1, \"y\":2} Discussion A dictionary is a mapping between a set of keys and values The .keys() method on a dict returns keys-view object of the dict. This keys-view object support common set operations like join , intersection , difference etc. These set operations are supported because it is guranteed that the keys of a dict are uniquely hashable. The .items() method on a dict returns items-view object consisting of (key, value) pairs. This items-view object also supports common set operations as above. The .values() method on the dict returns a values-view object consisting of values of the dict. BUT, this values-view object DOES-NOT SUPPORT common set operations because the values of a dict are not guranteed to be unique . Although, if necessary we can always convert this values-view object into a set and then perform required set-operations as usual. 1.10: Removing duplicates from a Sequence (maintaining order) Problem You want to remove duplicates from the sequence while maintaining order Solution If the values in a sequence are hashable, then we solve this problem by using set and generator 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 def dedupe ( items ): seen = set () for x in items : if x not in seen : yield x seen . add ( x ) ##----------------------------------## a = [ 1 , 5 , 2 , 1 , 9 , 1 , 5 , 10 ] list ( dedupe ( a )) ## [1, 5, 2, 9, 10] ## NOTE: above the order of the items in the output list is maintained according to the input \"a\" But this above solution is valid only if the items in the sequence are hashable . For sequences, which have unhashable items (like dict ), the below solution works: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 def dedupe_unhashable ( items , key = None ): seen = set () for item in items : val = item if key is None else key ( item ) if val not in seen : yield item seen . add ( item ) Here, the purpose of the key argument is to specify a function that converts sequence items into hashable type for the purpose of duplicate detection . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 a = [{ \"x\" : 1 , \"y\" : 2 }, { \"x\" : 1 , \"y\" : 3 }, { \"X\" : 1 , \"y\" : 2 }, { \"x\" : 2 , \"y\" : 4 } ] 1 list ( dedupe_unhashable ( a , key = lambda d : ( d [ \"x\" ], d [ \"y\" ]))) 1 2 3 [{ \"x\" :1, \"y\" :2 } , { \"x\" :1, \"y\" :3 } , { \"x\" :2, \"y\" :4 }] 1 list ( dedupe_unhashable ( a , key = lambda d : ( d [ \"x\" ]))) 1 2 [{ \"x\" :1, \"y\" :2 } , { \"x\" :2, \"y\" :4 }] This solution will work for any kind of data structure and a key function that returns a hashable value 1.12: Frequency of items in a Sequence Problem You have a sequence of hashable items asn you would want ot count the frequency of each item in the sequence. Solution Use collections.Counter Suppose we are give a list of strings words as shown below and we want to find the frequency of each word in the list 1 2 3 4 5 6 words = [ 'look' , 'into' , 'my' , 'eyes' , 'look' , 'into' , 'my' , 'eyes' , 'the' , 'eyes' , 'the' , 'eyes' , 'the' , 'eyes' , 'not' , 'around' , 'the' , 'eyes' , \"don't\" , 'look' , 'around' , 'the' , 'eyes' , 'look' , 'into' , 'my' , 'eyes' , \"you're\" , 'under' ] 1 2 3 4 5 from collections import Counter word_counts = Counter ( words ) top_three = word_counts . most_common ( 3 ) ## returns the 3 most common items print ( top_three ) ## [('eyes', 8), ('the', 5), ('look', 4)] The Counter class has a method most_common() which returns the topn \"n\" most common items in the sequence. Discussion As input, the Counter object can be fed any sequence of hashable items. The Counter object is basically just a dictionary that holds the unique items in the input sequence as its keys and their resepective counts as its values . If you want to increment the count manually , simply use addition op. 1 2 3 morewords = [ 'why' , 'are' , 'you' , 'not' , 'looking' , 'in' , 'my' , 'eyes' ] for word in morewords : word_counts [ word ] += 1 Alternative, you can also use update method on the Counter object to update the counter object. 1 word_counts . update ( morewords ) ## does the same work as the above addiotion op. The Counter object also supports common mathematical operations like sum , difference etc. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from collections import Counter words = [ \"hello\" , \"world\" , \"hello\" , \"world\" , \"earth\" ] morewords = [ \"hello\" , \"vinay\" , \"earth\" ] a = Counter ( words ) ## {\"hello\":2, \"world\":2, \"earth\":1} b = Counter ( morewords ) ## {\"hello\":1, \"vinay\":1, \"earth\":1} ## adding the two counter objects together a + b ## {\"hello\":3, \"world\":2, \"earth\":2, \"vinay\":1} ## subtracting the two counter objects a - b ## {\"hello\":1, \"world\":2, \"vinay\":1} 1.13: Sorting a List of dicts by a common key Problem You have a list of dictionaries and you would like to sort the items according to one or more of the dict values Solution Sorting this type of structure is easy using operator module's itemgetter() function. Let's say you've queried a database table to get a listing of the members on your website, and you receive the following data structure in return. 1 2 3 4 5 6 rows = [ { 'fname' : 'Brian' , 'lname' : 'Jones' , 'uid' : 1003 }, { 'fname' : 'David' , 'lname' : 'Beazley' , 'uid' : 1002 }, { 'fname' : 'John' , 'lname' : 'Cleese' , 'uid' : 1001 }, { 'fname' : 'Big' , 'lname' : 'Jones' , 'uid' : 1004 } ] It is fairly easy to output these rows ordered by any of the fields common to all of the rows in the dict. For example: 1 2 3 4 from operator import itemgetter rows_by_fname = sorted ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"fname\" )) rows_by_uid = sorted ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"uid\" )) 1 print ( rows_by_fname ) 1 2 3 4 [{'fname': 'Big', 'uid': 1004, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'Brian', 'uid': 1003, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'David', 'uid': 1002, 'lname': 'Beazley'}, {'fname': 'John', 'uid': 1001, 'lname': 'Cleese'}] 1 print ( rows_by_uid ) 1 2 3 4 [{'fname': 'John', 'uid': 1001, 'lname': 'Cleese'}, {'fname': 'David', 'uid': 1002, 'lname': 'Beazley'}, {'fname': 'Brian', 'uid': 1003, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'Big', 'uid': 1004, 'lname': 'Jones'}] The itemgetter() function also accepts multiple keys as arguments 1 2 rows_by_lfname = sorted ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"lname\" , \"fname\" )) print ( rows_by_lfname ) 1 2 3 4 [{'fname': 'David', 'uid': 1002, 'lname': 'Beazley'}, {'fname': 'John', 'uid': 1001, 'lname': 'Cleese'}, {'fname': 'Big', 'uid': 1004, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'Brian', 'uid': 1003, 'lname': 'Jones'}] Discussion In this example, rows is passed to the built-in sorted() function which accepts a keyword argument key . The key argument is expected to be a callable that accepts a single item from rows as input and returns a single value that is used as a basis for sorting. The itemgetter() is just such a callable. The operator.itemgetter() function takes as argument the lookup indices which is used to extract the desired values from the records in the rows . It can be a dictionary key name, a numeric list element, or any value that can be fed to the object's __getitem__() method. If you give multiple indices to itemgetter() , the callable it produces will return a tuple with all the indexed elements into it; which is then passed to the sorted() function. This is important if you want to simulatenously sort on multiple fields (as shown in above example rows_by_lfname , ie.e sorting by lname first then by fname ). The functionality of itemgetter() is sometimes replaced by lambda expressions, 1 2 rows_by_fanme = sorted ( rows , key = lambda r : r [ \"fname\" ]) rows_by_lfname = sorted ( rows , key = lambda r : ( r [ \"lname\" ], r [ \"fname\" ])) But itemgetter() is faster than lambda expressions. Note that this technique can also be used for other functions that does their operations which require key callable function such as min() , max() etc. 1 2 3 from operator import itemgetter min ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"uid\" )) ## {'fname': 'John', 'lname': 'Cleese', 'uid': 1001} max ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"uid\" )) ## {'fname': 'Big', 'lname': 'Jones', 'uid': 1004} 1.14: Sorting objects w/o native comparision support Problem You want to sort objects of the same class; but they don't natively support comparision operation. Solution The built-in sorted() function takes a key argument that can be passed a callable that will return a value in the object that sorted() will use to compare the objects. For example, if you have sequence of User instances and you want to sort the items in the sequence using their used_id attribute; you would supply a callable that will take a User instance as input and return the user_id of that input which can then be used by sorted() function as a key to sort the instances in the sequence. This is illustrated in the below code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 class User : def __init__ ( self , user_id ): self . user_id = user_id def __repr__ ( self ): return f \"User( { self . user_id } )\" ## ---------------------------------------------- ## users = [ User ( 23 ), User ( 1 ), User ( 9 )] sorted ( users , key = lambda u : u . user_id ) ## [User(1), User(9), User(23)] Instead of using lambda , you can use a faster operator.attrgetter() function 1 2 from operator import attrgetter sorted ( users , key = attrgetter ( \"user_id\" )) ## [user(1), User(9), User(23)] Discussion The choice of whether to use lambda or operator.attrgetter() is personal, but operator.attrgetter() is a bit faster and supports multiple attribute indexing as shown below. Suppose the User class has two attributes user_id and user_name and we want to sort sequence of User instances based on both these attributes; then we can use operator.attrgetter() very easily. 1 2 3 4 from operator import attrgetter ## assume that \"User\" class has two attributes \"user_id\" and \"user_name\" sorted ( users , key = attrgetter ( \"user_id\" , \"user_name\" )) This behavior of attrgetter() is analogous to itemgetter() function (used for dictionaries ) Similar to itemgetter() , we can use attrgetter() for other comparision operations that require a key attribute such as min() , max() etc. 1 2 min ( users , key = attrgetter ( \"user_id\" )) max ( users , key = attrgetter ( \"user_id\" ))","title":"1.

Discussion The core of this recipe concerns with the use of heapq module. The methods heapq.heappush() and heapq.heappop() insert and remove items from self._queue in such a way that the first tem in the list has the smallest priority . The heappop() method always returns the smallest item; so that is the key idea to make our PriorityQueue pop correct items. In this recipe the queue consists of tuple (-priority, idx, item) . The priority value is negated to get the queue to sort items from highest priority to lowest priority . This is opposite from normal heap ordering; which sorts items from smallest to highest value. The role of the idx value is to properly order items with the same priority level. By keeping a constantly increasing index, the items will be sorted according to the order in which they were inserted. However, the idx also serves an important role in making the comparision work for items with the smae priority level.

Let's say you've queried a database table to get a listing of the members on your website, and you receive the following data structure in return. 1 2 3 4 5 6 rows = [ { 'fname' : 'Brian' , 'lname' : 'Jones' , 'uid' : 1003 }, { 'fname' : 'David' , 'lname' : 'Beazley' , 'uid' : 1002 }, { 'fname' : 'John' , 'lname' : 'Cleese' , 'uid' : 1001 }, { 'fname' : 'Big' , 'lname' : 'Jones' , 'uid' : 1004 } ] It is fairly easy to output these rows ordered by any of the fields common to all of the rows in the dict. For example: 1 2 3 4 from operator import itemgetter rows_by_fname = sorted ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"fname\" )) rows_by_uid = sorted ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"uid\" )) 1 print ( rows_by_fname ) 1 2 3 4 [{'fname': 'Big', 'uid': 1004, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'Brian', 'uid': 1003, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'David', 'uid': 1002, 'lname': 'Beazley'}, {'fname': 'John', 'uid': 1001, 'lname': 'Cleese'}] 1 print ( rows_by_uid ) 1 2 3 4 [{'fname': 'John', 'uid': 1001, 'lname': 'Cleese'}, {'fname': 'David', 'uid': 1002, 'lname': 'Beazley'}, {'fname': 'Brian', 'uid': 1003, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'Big', 'uid': 1004, 'lname': 'Jones'}] The itemgetter() function also accepts multiple keys as arguments 1 2 rows_by_lfname = sorted ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"lname\" , \"fname\" )) print ( rows_by_lfname ) 1 2 3 4 [{'fname': 'David', 'uid': 1002, 'lname': 'Beazley'}, {'fname': 'John', 'uid': 1001, 'lname': 'Cleese'}, {'fname': 'Big', 'uid': 1004, 'lname': 'Jones'}, {'fname': 'Brian', 'uid': 1003, 'lname': 'Jones'}] Discussion In this example, rows is passed to the built-in sorted() function which accepts a keyword argument key . The key argument is expected to be a callable that accepts a single item from rows as input and returns a single value that is used as a basis for sorting. The itemgetter() is just such a callable. The operator.itemgetter() function takes as argument the lookup indices which is used to extract the desired values from the records in the rows . It can be a dictionary key name, a numeric list element, or any value that can be fed to the object's __getitem__() method. If you give multiple indices to itemgetter() , the callable it produces will return a tuple with all the indexed elements into it; which is then passed to the sorted() function. This is important if you want to simulatenously sort on multiple fields (as shown in above example rows_by_lfname , ie.e sorting by lname first then by fname ). The functionality of itemgetter() is sometimes replaced by lambda expressions, 1 2 rows_by_fanme = sorted ( rows , key = lambda r : r [ \"fname\" ]) rows_by_lfname = sorted ( rows , key = lambda r : ( r [ \"lname\" ], r [ \"fname\" ])) But itemgetter() is faster than lambda expressions. Note that this technique can also be used for other functions that does their operations which require key callable function such as min() , max() etc. 1 2 3 from operator import itemgetter min ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"uid\" )) ## {'fname': 'John', 'lname': 'Cleese', 'uid': 1001} max ( rows , key = itemgetter ( \"uid\" )) ## {'fname': 'Big', 'lname': 'Jones', 'uid': 1004}","title":"1.13: Sorting a List of dicts by a common key"},{"location":"python/cookbook_dabeaz/ch01/#114-sorting-objects-wo-native-comparision-support","text":"Problem You want to sort objects of the same class; but they don't natively support comparision operation.

This is illustrated in the below code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 class User : def __init__ ( self , user_id ): self . user_id = user_id def __repr__ ( self ): return f \"User( { self . user_id } )\" ## ---------------------------------------------- ## users = [ User ( 23 ), User ( 1 ), User ( 9 )] sorted ( users , key = lambda u : u . user_id ) ## [User(1), User(9), User(23)] Instead of using lambda , you can use a faster operator.attrgetter() function 1 2 from operator import attrgetter sorted ( users , key = attrgetter ( \"user_id\" )) ## [user(1), User(9), User(23)] Discussion The choice of whether to use lambda or operator.attrgetter() is personal, but operator.attrgetter() is a bit faster and supports multiple attribute indexing as shown below.

In this tutorial we will look into some of the advance usage of functions viz. closures callback-functions control-flow keyword-only arguments default-arguments annotations any-number-of-arguments ( *args & **kwargs ) etc. 7.1: Function with any number of arguments ( *args, **kwargs ) Problem You want to write a function that accepts any number of arguments. Solution For a function that accepts any number of positional arguments use a * argument. For a function that accepts any number of keyword arguments use a ** argument. To write any function that accepts any numbe rof positional arguments, use a * argument as shown below. In this example, rest is a tuple of all extra positional arguments passed. In above code, it is treated as a sequence in further calculations inside the function. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 def avg ( first , * rest ): return ( first + sum ( rest )) / ( 1 + len ( rest )) ## ------------------------------------------------- ## avg ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ## return=2.0; first=1, rest=(2, 3) avg ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) ## return=2.5; first=1, rest=(2, 3, 4) To accept any number of keyword arguments use a ** argument as shown below.

For example consider the following code: 1 msg = recv ( 1024 , False ) If someone is not familiar with recv (written in above section), they might not know what does False mean in this scenario. On the other hand, its much clearer to the user if someone writes the call as below: 1 msg = recv ( 1024 , block = False ) The use of keyword-only arguments is often very useful for tricks involving **kwargs , since they show up nicely when the user asks for help() 1 2 3 4 >>> help ( recv ) Help on function recv in module __main__: recv ( maxsize, *, block ) : \"\"\"Receives a message\"\"\" Keyword-only arguments also have utility in advance usage like argument injection using *args & **kwargs . 7.3: Function argument annotations Problem You've written a function but you want add some additional information about the arguments so that users can know more easily how a function is supposed to be used. Solution Function argument annotations can be very useful in givin gprogrammers hint about how a function is supposed to be used. Cosider the following annotated function. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ## normal function definition def add ( x , y ): return x + y ## Annotated function definition -- MUCH BETTER for users def add ( x : int , y : int ) -> int : return x + y The Python Interpreter does not add any semantic meaning to the attached annotations. Neither are they type-cheked nor does Puython behave any differently than before. However, they might give useful hunts about types that would be useful for users or third-party libraries. Any type of object can be uased as an annotation (eg. numbers, string, instances, types, etc.). Discussion Function annotations are merely stored in function's __annotations__ attribute. 1 2 3 4 5 >>> add . __annotations__ { \"y\" : < class \" int \">, \"return\" : < class \" int \">, \"x\" : < class \" int \">, } Although, annotations have many potential use-cases, their primary utility is probably just documentation . Because Python does not have type decalrations, it can be difficult to read a source code without much documentation and hind about the types of objects; function annotations are one way to resolve this problem. More advance usage of function annotations is to implement multiple dispatch (i.e. overloaded functions ) 7.7: Capturing variables in Anonymous functions Problem You have defined an anonymous function using lambda and but you also need to capture the value of certain variable at the tim eof definition. Solution Consider the behaviour of the following code a python console: 1 2 3 4 5 >>> x = 10 >>> a = lambda y : x + y >>> >>> x = 20 >>> b = lambda y : x + y Now ask yourself a question. What is the value of a(10) and b(10) now? If you think that the values will be 20 and 30 ; you would be wrong. The python console gives the follwoing results. 1 2 3 4 5 >>> a ( 10 ) 30 >>> >>> b ( 10 ) 30 The problem here is that x used here (in the lambda expression) is a free variable ; that gets bound at runtime , not at definition time . The value x in the lambda expression is whatever the value of x variable happens to be at the time of execution of the statement a(10), b(10) . For example see below code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 >>> x = 15 >>> a ( 10 ) 25 >>> >>> x = 3 >>> a ( 10 ) 13 If you want an anonymous lambda function to capture a value at the point of definition include that value as a default value in the lambda expression definition as follows. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 >>> x = 10 >>> a = lambda y , x = x : x + y >>> >>> x = 20 >>> b = lambda y , x = x : x + y >>> >>> a ( 10 ) 20 ## Note the difference here from above code (earlier this was 30) >>> >>> b ( 10 ) 30 ## Note that \"b\" captured the correct value of \"x\" Discussion The problem addressed here comes up very often in code that tries to be a just a bit more clever. For example, creating a list of lambda expressions using a list comprehension or a loop of some kind and expecting the lambda expressions to remember the iteration variable at the time of defintion . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 >>> funcs = [ lambda x : x + n for n in range ( 5 )] >>> for f in funcs : ... print ( f ( 0 )) ... 4 4 4 4 4 >>> Notice, how all lambda expressions take the same final value of n from the range(5) expression. But, if we specifically captuer the value of n using default arguments , then we get the behaviour we want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 >>> funcs = [ lambda x , n = n : x + n for n in range ( 5 )] >>> for f in funcs : ... print ( f ( 0 )) ... 0 1 2 3 4 >>> 7.8: functools.partial() Making an N-argumnet callable work asa callable with fewwer argumnets You have a callable that you want to make it work with other Python code. possbly as a callabel or handler , but it takes too many argumnets and causes an exception when called. Solution If you need to reduce the number of arguments to a function, you should use functools.partial() The partial() function allows you to assign fixed values to one or more of the arguments thus reduce the number of required argumnets in subsequent calls of the reduced function . as shown below. 1 2 def spam ( a , b , c , d ): print ( a , b , c , d ) Now consider functools.partial() to fix certain arguments. 1 2 3 4 5 >>> from functools import partial >>> >>> s1 = partial ( spam , 1 ) ## a=1 >>> s1 ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) ## note that it takes only 3 arguments 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 >>> s2 = partial ( spam , d = 42 ) ## d=42 >>> s2 ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) 1 2 3 42 >>> s2 ( 5 , 99 , 32 ) 5 99 32 42 1 2 3 4 >>> s3 = partial ( spam , 1 , 2 , d = 42 ) ## a=1, b=2, d=42 >>> s3 ( 99 ) 1 2 99 42 >>> Discussion ... 7.9: Replacing single method classes with functions Problem You have a class that only defines a single method except __init__() method. However, to simplify your code, you would much rather have a simple function. Solution In many cases, single method classes can be turned into functions using closures . Consider the following example, which allws users to fetch URLs using a kind of template-scheme . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 from urllib.request import urlopen class UrlTemplate : def __init__ ( self , template ): self . template = template def open ( self , ** kwargs ): return urlopen ( self . template . format_map ( kwargs )) ## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## ## Usage of above class ## Example Use: Download stock data from yahoo yahoo = UrlTemplate ( \"http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s= {names} &f= {fields} \" ) for line in yahoo . open ( names = \"APPL, FB, TSLA\" , fields = \"sl1c1v\" ): print ( line . decode ( \"utf-8\" )) This URLTemplate class be very easily replaced with a much simpler function using closures . as shown below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ## Using closures from urllib.request import urlopen def url_template ( template ): def opener ( ** kwargs ): return urlopen ( template . format_map ( kwargs )) return opener ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## ## Example Usage of the above CLOSURE \"url_template\" yahoo = url_template ( \"http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s= {names} &f= {fields} \" ) for line in yahoo ( names = \"APPL, FB, TSLA\" , fileds = \"sl1c1v\" ): print ( line . decode ( \"utf-8\" )) 7.10: Carrying extra state with callback functions Problem You are writing code that relies on the use of callback functions (e.g. event handlers , completion callback , etc.); but you want to have the callback function carry extra state to be used inside the callback function itself. Solution Let's first talk about callback functions which are used in asynchronous processing via the following example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 def apply_async ( func , args , * , callback ): ## compute the result result = func ( * args ) ## invoke the callback callback ( result ) In reality, such code might do all sorts of advanced processing involving threads, processes, & timers. But here we are just focusing on the invocation of the callback . Below, we show how to use the above code: 1 2 3 4 5 def print_result ( result ): print ( f \"Got: { result } \" ) def add ( x , y ): return x + y 1 2 3 4 >>> apply_async ( add , ( 2 , 3 ), callback = print_result ) Got : 5 >>> apply_result ( add , ( 'Hello\", \"World' ), callback = print_result ) Got : \"HelloWorld\" As you can notice above, the callbakc function print_result() only accepts a single argument i.e result . No other information is provided. This lack of information can be an issue when we want our callback function to interact with other contextual variables or other parts of the code. Below we provide some probable solutions to handle this issue: Some ways to carry extra information with callbacks: Use bound methods instead of regular sinple functions. Use closures Use coroutines . Using functools.partial() Using BOUND METHODS : One way to carry extra information in a callback is to use bound methods instead of simple function. For example, this below class keeps an internal sequence number that is incremented everytime a result is received. 1 2 3 4 5 6 class ResultHandler : def __init__ ( self ): self . sequence = 0 def handler ( self , result ): self . sequence += 1 print ( f \"[ { self . sequence } ] Got: { result } \" ) To use this class ResultHandler , we need to create its instance and use its handler() method as a callback. 1 2 3 4 5 >>> rh = ResultHandler () ## creating an instance of the class >>> apply_async ( add , ( 2 , 3 ), callback = rh . handler ) [ 1 ] Got : 5 >>> apply_async ( add , ( \"Hello\" , \"World\" ), callback = rh . handler ) [ 2 ] Got : \"HelloWorld\" Notice in the above output, how the instance of ResultHandler class rh uses its internal state variable self.sequence across two different calls of the callback function rh.handler . Using CLOSURES : As an alternative we can also use closures to embed additional information in the callback function. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 def make_handler (): sequence = 0 def handler ( result ): nonlocal sequence sequence += 1 print ( f \"[ { sequence } ] Got: { result } \" ) return handler 1 2 3 4 5 >>> handler = make_handler () ## our callback function to be used >>> apply_async ( add , ( 2 , 3 ), callback = handler ) [ 1 ] Got : 5 >>> apply_async ( add , ( \"Hello\" , \"World\" ), callback = handler ) [ 2 ] Got : \"HelloWorld\" ## the callback remembers the count sequence Using COROUTINES : Sometimes we can also use a coroutine to accomplish what we achieved using a bound method or a closure . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ## Using COROUTINES to add context to a callback function def make_handler (): sequence = 0 while True : result = yield sequence += 1 print ( f \"[ { sequence } ] Got: { result } \" ) We can use it as usual as before. 1 2 3 4 5 >>> handler = make_handler () ## our callback function >>> apply_async ( add , ( 2 , 3 ), callback = handler . send ) [ 1 ] Got : 5 >>> apply_async ( add , ( \"Hello\" , \"WORLD!!\" ), callback = handler . send ) [ 2 ] Got : \"HelloWORLD!!\" NOTICE the use of send to push value to the yield in the callback coroutine Using functools.partial() : As an alternative, we can also carry state into a callback using an extra argument and a partial function application. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 class SeqeunceNo : def __init__ ( self ): self . sequence = 0 def handler ( result , seq ): seq . sequence += 1 print ( f \"[ { seq . sequence } ] Got: { result } \" ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 >>> from functools import partial >>> seq = SequenceNo () >>> apply_async ( add , ( 2 , 3 ), callback = partial ( handler , seq = seq )) [ 1 ] Got : 5 >>> apply_async ( add , ( \"HELLO_\" , \"WORLD!!!\" ), callback = partial ( handler , seq = seq )) [ 2 ] Got : \"HELLO_WORLD!!!\" Discussion Software based on callback functions often runs the risk of turning into a huge tangled mess. Part of the reason is that callback function is often disconnected from the code that made the initial request leading up the callback execution\". Thus the execution environment between making the request and handling the result is effectively lost. If you want the callback function to continue with a procedure involving multiple steps, you have to figure out how to save and restore the associated states. There are really two main promising ways to capture and restore context states: You can carry it around in a class instance . Attach it to bound method perhaps. Or you can carry it around in a closure (an inner function). Of the above two techniques, probably the closures approach is more natural and lightweight in that they are built from functions. They also automatically captures all the variables used. But, if using closures , we need to pay careful attention to mutable variables.","title":"7.

Solution For a function that accepts any number of positional arguments use a * argument. For a function that accepts any number of keyword arguments use a ** argument. To write any function that accepts any numbe rof positional arguments, use a * argument as shown below. In this example, rest is a tuple of all extra positional arguments passed.
