In the context of Object Oriented Programming, 
a **protocol** is an _informal interface that is defined only in the documentation, not in code_.

For eg., the **sequence protocol** in Python entails just the `__len__()` and `__getitem__()` methods.
Any class `Spam` that uses those methods can be used as a **sequence**
