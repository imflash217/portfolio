Iterators are one of Python's most powerful features. 
At a high level, you might view **iteration** simply as a way to process items in a sequence,
but there is much more than this such as creating your own iterator object, applying useful
iterator patterns in **`itertools`** module, make generator functions etc.

## 4.1: Manually consuming an iterator

???+ danger "problem"
    You wan tto consume items in an **iterable** but for whatever reasons you can't
    or don't want to use a **`for`** loop

???+ done "Solution"
    To manually consume the **iterable**, use the **`next()`** function and write
    code to catch the **`StopIteration`** exception as shown below.

    ```python hl_lines="4 6-7"
    with open("etc/passwd") as f:
        try:
            while True:
                line = next(f)
                print(line, end="")
        except StopIteration:
            pass
    ```
    
    :rotating_light: Normally **`StopIteration`** exception is used to signal the end of the sequence.
    
    :trophy: But, if you are using **`next`**, you can instruct `next()` to return a **terminating value**
    like `None` as shown below.

    ```python hl_lines="4-6"
    with open("etc/passwd") as f:
        try:
            while True:
                line = next(f, None)
                if line is None:
                    break
                print(line, end="")
    ```

???+ quote "Discussion"
    In most cases the **`for`** is used to consume the iterable.
    However every now and then a problem statement calls for precise control over
    the underlying mechanism. The below example explains what happens underneath 
    the iteration protocol.

    ```zsh hl_lines="4 5 12-14"
    >>> items= [1, 2, 3]        ## the iterable
    >>> 
    >>> ## Get the iterator
    >>> it = iter(items)        ## invokes "items.__iter__()"
    >>> next(it)                ## invokes "items.__next__()"
    1
    >>> next(it)
    2
    >>> next(it)
    3
    >>> next(it)    ## this triggers "StopIteration" exception b'coz the iterator "it" is empty now
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        file "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    StopIteration
    ```

## 4.2: Delegating Iteration

???+ danger "Problem"
    You have built a custom container object that internallt holds a `list` or `tuple` 
    or other **iterables**. You want the **iteration** to work with this custom container.

???+ done "Solution"
    Typically all you need to do is to define an internal **`iter()`** method that delegates iteration
    to internally held container as shown below.

    ```python hl_lines="4 12-13 24-25"
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self._value = value
            self._children = []

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"Node{self._value!r}"

        def add_child(self, node):
            self._children.append(node)

        def __iter__(self):
            return iter(self._children)     ## forwars the iteration request to the "self._children" 
    
    ## ---------------------------------------------- ##

    if __naame__ == "__main__":
        root = Node(0)
        child1 = Node(1)
        child2 = Node(2)
        root.add_child(child1)
        root.add_child(child2)

        for ch in root:
            print(ch)
    ```
    ```ipython
    >>> Node(1)
        Node(2)
    ```
    :trophy: In the above example, the **`__iter__()`** method simply forwards the iteration request
    to the internally held **`self._children`** attribute.

???+ quote "Discussion"
    Python's **iterator protocol** requires the **`__iter__()`** method to return a special 
    iterator object that implements a **`__next__()`** method which actually carries out 
    the actual iteration.

    In the above example, we are delegating the implemeation of **`__next__()`** method 
    by returning a **list** (`iter(self._children)`) which internally implements **`__iter__()`**.

    :rotating_light: Calling the **`iter(x)`** function internally calls **`x.__iter__()`**.
    Note that this behaviour is similar to `len(seq)` and `seq.__len__()`
