Iterators are one of Python's most powerful features. 
At a high level, you might view **iteration** simply as a way to process items in a sequence,
but there is much more than this such as creating your own iterator object, applying useful
iterator patterns in **`itertools`** module, make generator functions etc.

## 4.1: Manually consuming an iterator

???+ danger "problem"
    You wan tto consume items in an **iterable** but for whatever reasons you can't
    or don't want to use a **`for`** loop

???+ done "Solution"
    To manually consume the **iterable**, use the **`next()`** function and write
    code to catch the **`StopIteration`** exception as shown below.

    ```python hl_lines="4"
    with open("etc/passwd") as f:
        try:
            while True:
                line = next(f)
                print(line, end="")
        except StopIteration:
            pass
    ```
    
    :rotating_light: Normally **`StopIteration`** exception is used to signal he end of the sequence.
    
    :trophy: But, if you are using **`next`**, you can instruct `next()` to return a **terminating value**
    like `None` as shown below.

    ```python hl_lines="4"
    with open("etc/passwd") as f:
        try:
            while True:
                line = next(f, None)
                print(line, end="")
    ```
