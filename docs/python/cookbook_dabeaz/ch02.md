Almost every useful program involve some kind of text processing
whether it is data or generating output. 
Here we discuss about challenges involving text manipulation **`searching`, `substitution`,
`lexing`, `parsing`** etc.

:rotating_light: Many of these problems can be easily solved with **built-in** methods.
While more complicated operations might require the use of **regular expressions**.

## 2.1: Splitting string on any of multiple delimeters

???+ danger "Problem"
    You need to split the string into fields but the **delimiters**
    (and the space around them) aren't consistent throughtout the string.

???+ done "Solution"
    The **`str.split()`** method of string objects is really meant for **very simple use cases**
    and **doesn't** allow for multiple _delimiters_. 

    :rotating_light: In case you need a bit more flexibility use **`re.split()`** instead as shown below.

    ```python
    import re
    
    line = "vinay kumar, ram; lakshmi,           devi         anil-kumar-ram"
    
    re.split(r"[;,-\s]\s*", line)   
    ## ["vinay", "kumar", "ram", "lakshmi", "devi", "anil", "kumar", "ram"]
    ```
