The primary focus in this article is to provide common programming patterns related
to class definitions. Some of the topics include:

1. Making objects support common Python features.
2. usage of special methods.
3. Encapsulation techniques.
4. Inheritence.
5. Memory management.
6. Useful Design Patterns.

## 8.1: `__str__()` & `__repr__()`

???+ danger "Problem"
    You want to change the output produced by printing or viewing instances to something more sensible.

???+ done "Solution"
    To change the string representation of the **class instances** define 
    **`__str__()`** & **`__repr__()`** methods as shown below.

    ```python
    class Pair:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
        def __str__(self):
            return "({0.x!s}, {0.y!s})".format(self)
        def __repr__(self):
            return "Pair({0.x!r}, {0.y!r})".format(self)
    ```
