## Another Solution

- [ ] Can do better with **Hash Tables** in $O(1)$ expected time, $O(n+m)$ space; 
_where **m** is the table size_


## An example

- [ ] Let `keys` be the student ids of students registered in class **CLS201**; _eg. 2022CS10110_.
- [ ] There are $100$ students in the class, so we create a hash-table of size _say_ 100.
- [ ] Hash function **`hash()`** is _say_, the last two digits of the _student-id_.
