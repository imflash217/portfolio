# Regular Expressions

One of the unsung successes in standardization of computer science has been the
**Regular Expressions (RE)**, a language for specifying text search strings.
This practical language is in every computer language, word processor, and 
text processing tools like the Unix's **`grep`**. 

> :trophy: A regular expression is an algebraic notation for characterizing a set of strings.

They are particularly useful for searching in texts, when we have a **pattern** to search for
and a **corpus** of texts to search through. 
A regex search function will search through the corpus returning all teexts that match the pattern.
The corpus can be a single document or a collection. 
For example, the Unix cmd tool **`grep`** takes a regex and 
returns every line of the input document that matches the pattern in regex.

:rotating_light: RegEx comes in many variants. Int his article we will be discussing
**extended regex**.
