## Word Meaning

- [x] Denotational Semantics
- [x] Distributional Semantics
- [x] Localist Representation (like `one-hot vectors`)
- [x] Distributed Representation (like `word-vectors`)

???+ bug "Problems with toolkits like `WordNet`"

    - [x] Great as a resource but missing `nuance`
        * [ ] Example: `proficent` is listed as a synonym for `good`; but it is correct only in some contexts.
    - [x] Missing new meaning of words
        * [ ] Example: new slang words etc like `wicked`, `badass`, `nifty` etc.
        * [ ] IMPOSSIBLE to keep up-to-date
    - [x] Very Subjective
    - [x] Requires human labour to curate and maintain
    - [x] Can't compute accurate word-similarity.
