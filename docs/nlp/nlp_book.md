# NLP notes:

## Text Normalization

Normalizing text means converting them into a more convenient, stndard form.
For example, most of what we are going to do with language relies on first 
separating out or **tokenizing** words from running text  (which is called as **tokenization**).

### Tokenization

### Lemmatization

### Stemming

### Sentence Segmentation

## Edit Distance
