???+ note "What is Machine Learning?"
    It is a field that aims to extract relationships and structures in the data.
    `Example: How to map data to annotations?`

???+ note "Loss Function"
    We need a **measure** to see how well our system is doing at learning.
    This measure is called **Loss Function**

    - [x] Sum-of-Squared-Error (SSE): $2^2$ $\sum_{i}||(y_i - f(x_i)||_2^2$

- [ ] Sum-of-Squared-Error (SSE): 

$2^2$ $\sum_{i}||(y_i - f(x_i)||_2^2$

???+ note "Training"
    The process of teaching our system to minimize errors is called as **Training**.

???+ note "Evaluation"
    The process of determining the _performance_ of our trained system over an **unseen dataset** is called as **Evaluation**.

???+ note "Unsupervised Learning"
    - [x] Generative Models (GAN, AE, RBM)
    - [x] Latent Variable Modeling (PCA, AE)
    - [ ] Clustering
