# `numpy` v/s `pandas`

One subtle aspect that lot of engineers miss is the `access control` design of `numpy` and `pandas`.

1. `numpy` uses **row-major** access control.
2. `pandas` uses **column-major** access control.

Genrally its seen that engineers complain about slow-nature of `numpy` compared to `pandas`. One of the prime culprits of this issue is the lack of knowledge about the *access control* used in these libraries. 

By default, `numpy` uses row-major but it allows the user to specify the access control while creating the `ndarray`. Below, are all senarios of accessing the row/col using pandas or numpy is shown.

### Itertating numpy `ndarray` using column-major
```python
import numpy as np
df_np = df.to_numpy()
n_rows, n_cols = df_np.shape

start = time.time()
for j in range(n_cols):
    for item in df_np[:, j]:
        pass

print(time.time() - start, "seconds")
```
```
>>> 0.0058 seconds
```

### Itertating numpy `ndarray` using row-major (default)
```python
import numpy as np
df_np = df.to_numpy()
n_rows, n_cols = df_np.shape

start = time.time()

for i in range(n_rows):
    for item in df_np[i]:
        pass

print(time.time()-start, "seconds")
```
```
>>> 0.0195 seconds
```
