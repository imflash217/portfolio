## Correction of Distribution Shifts

### Covariate Shift Correction

### Label Shift Correction

### Concept Shift Correction

**Concept Shift** is much harder to fix in a principled manner.
For instance, in a situation where the problem suddenly changes from
classifying **`cats` v/s `dogs`** to classying **`white` v/s `black` animals**;
it will be _unreasonable_ to assume that we can do much better by collecting new labels and training
from scratch.

Fortunately, in practice such concept-shifts are very rare, but instead it is usually observed that the 
_task keeps on changing gradually_. For example:

1. Traffic Camera lenses degrade over time due to wear-&-tear and hence the quality of images degrade too.
2. News content changes gradually; i.e. new stories appear while the news still remain almost same.
3. In computational advertising, new products gets launched and hence popularity of products changes 
and the CTR-Predictor needs to change as well.
