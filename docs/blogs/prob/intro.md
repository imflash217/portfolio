# Probablity Theory

A key concept in the field of **pattern recognition** is that of **uncertainity**.
It arrises through:

1. noise on measurements
2. finite size of datasets.

Probability theory provides a consistent framework for the quantification 
and manipulation of uncertainity and forms one of the central foundations
of Pattern Recognition.

When combined with **Decision Theory**, it allows us to make optimal predictions
given all the informtion available to us, even though that information may be incomplete or ambigous.
