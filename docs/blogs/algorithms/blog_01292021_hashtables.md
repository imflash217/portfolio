### `Definition:`

???+ note "Definition"
    **Hash Table** is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner.

    - In a hash table, the data is stored in an array format where each data-value has its own unique index-value. Due to this feature, the access to data becomes very fast if we know the desired index-value; irrespective of the size of the data.
    - Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash-technique to generate the index where an element is to be inserted or to be located from.
